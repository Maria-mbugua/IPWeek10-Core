# Text Translation Using Neural Networks

# a) Specifying the Question

Use neural networks to translate English text to a local Kenyan language(Kalenjin).

# b) Defining the Metrics of success

Building a model that can accurately translate English text to Kalenjin with an accuracy score of at least 85%.

# c) Understanding the context

There are several translation websites that mostly translate between international languages such as English to Swahili. In Kenya, there a professional bodies that offer translation and interpretation services. Hiring these services can be quite expensive especially when trying to communicate an important information such as constitution interpretation to a pre-dominantly native speaking community. Having a web application can greatly reduce this burden of having to outsource translation services everytime they are needed.

# d) Experimental Design

1. Loading the datasets.

2. Cleaning the datasets.

3. Preprocessing.

4. Creating a TensorFlow model.

5. Test Processing.

6. Training the model.

7. Translating.

8. Visualizing the process.

# e) Relevance of the data
